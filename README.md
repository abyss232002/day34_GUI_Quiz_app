# My Python Portfolio Project

## Overview

Welcome to my personal portfolio project! This project showcases my programming skills, particularly in Python, utilizing an object-oriented programming (OOP) approach. The project is powered by the [Open Trivia Database API](https://opentdb.com/api.php) and demonstrates my ability to dissect a business problem into classes with corresponding attributes and methods. Additionally, I've built a simple application UI using the Tkinter module.

## Project Highlights

- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Paradigm:** Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
- **API Integration:** [Open Trivia Database API](https://opentdb.com/api.php)
- **UI Framework:** Tkinter

## Features

1. **Class-based Structure:** The project is organized into classes that represent key components of the application. Each class is designed with well-defined attributes and methods, showcasing my OOP skills.

2. **API Integration:** Utilizing the Open Trivia Database API, the application fetches trivia questions dynamically, providing an interactive and dynamic user experience.

3. **Tkinter UI:** The user interface is built using the Tkinter module, offering a simple and intuitive design. The UI provides a seamless experience for users to interact with the trivia application.

4. **Problem Solving:** The project demonstrates my ability to analyze and dissect a business problem, translating it into classes and methods that efficiently handle the required functionality.
