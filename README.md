# Quiz App Portfolio Project

## Overview

Welcome to my personal portfolio project showcasing a simple Quiz app built in Python. This project demonstrates my programming skills, proficiency in object-oriented programming, integration of external APIs (powered by [Open Trivia Database](https://opentdb.com/api.php)), and the ability to design a simple application UI using the Tkinter module.

## Features

- **Object-Oriented Approach**: The Quiz app is built using a clear object-oriented programming (OOP) approach. Classes are defined to represent essential components of the application, including questions, quiz sessions, and UI elements.

- **API Integration**: The app utilizes the [Open Trivia Database API](https://opentdb.com/api.php) to fetch a variety of trivia questions. This integration showcases my ability to interact with external APIs and handle data retrieval seamlessly.

- **Problem Solution Dissection**: Each problem in the project is dissected into the required classes, attributes, and methods. This modular approach enhances code organization and readability.

- **Tkinter UI**: The graphical user interface is created using the Tkinter module, providing a user-friendly experience. The UI is designed to be intuitive, making the quiz-taking process enjoyable.
